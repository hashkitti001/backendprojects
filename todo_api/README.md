You're right, including authentication endpoints in the README is essential for providing comprehensive documentation. Here's an updated version of the README with authentication endpoints included:

**To-Do List API**

**Tech Stack Recommendations:**

- **Backend Framework**: Express (Node.js)
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL)

**Additional Notes:**

- Implement basic authentication middleware to protect sensitive operations like creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
- Validate incoming data to ensure data integrity and security.
- Thoroughly document API endpoints, including request and response formats, error handling, and authentication requirements.
- Test API endpoints rigorously using tools like Postman or automated testing frameworks.
- Consider deploying the API to a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Azure for accessibility and scalability.
